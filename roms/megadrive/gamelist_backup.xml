		<desc>Before the time of plants and animals, the earth was completely dark, and inhabited by things we now call 'monsters'. When some voice said 'Let There Be Light' , many monsters died because they could not live in this new light world. Not all died however; some of them hid in caves, and grew stronger. Now, they want to return to the world, and in these days you live your life.

On your fourteenth birthday you are given your deceased father's sword and shield. Now you are considered ready for the trials and maybe, just maybe, you can become a hero yourself.</desc>

		<name>다나 여신탄생</name>
		<desc>Dahna: Megami Tanjo (Dahna: Birth of a Goddess) is a beat'em up with some RPG elements. The player controls Dahna as she scrolls horizontally or vertically through the levels. Dahna fights her enemies using a sword, and she can jump in two heights, duck and crawl. Dahna has also a magic meter, which has several colored levels. Different levels of her magic will produce different magical effects (as in Golden Axe). Her magic can be replenished by gathering magical orbs, dropped by enemy mages when killed. They will also drop health orbs as well.

She starts the game "riding" a giant, and in other portions of the game, she'll also ride other creatures, such as a horse and a griffin. When riding a creature, Dahna can't use her magic powers.

As she kills enemies and gather orbs, Dahna gains experience points, which grant her level upgrades. Leveling up affects only her health, as she gains more health points.</desc>

		<desc>Exile concerns the desert adventures of Sadler, the great hero whose revolt years before led to the downfall of a powerful empire. Recently, however, peace was broken in Sadler's home country, as the rival Luciel empire has been launching attacks on the Village of Dunes.

Exile is a hybrid action/role-playing game. Travel and exploration occurs in the traditional overhead view of RPGs, while the battles and dungeons are side-scrolling mazes, similar to Wanderers from Ys. Characters gain experience and levels, buy equipment, and use magic.</desc>

		<desc>Danpei Ichigeki is a young boy who loves dodgeball. Danpei's father was a famous dodgeball player when he was still alive, and he joins the Dodgeball Club at his elementary school. However, these kids are very serious about their dodgeball, and the road ahead isn't going to be easy for Danpei.

Dodge Danpei is a team dodgeball game, one of several based on the anime and manga created by Tetsuhiro Koshita, which plays strikingly similar to the well-known Super Dodge Ball. Each team has four main players and three support players, and attempts to knock out the opposing team's main members by throwing the ball at them in various ways. Apart from normal throws, the player can also pass to teammates, and execute special power throws which are harder to dodge or catch.

The game includes several different game modes, including the main story mode which follows the story of the anime, as well as one- and two-player exhibition matches. There is also a "league" mode which allows for a tournament of up to six teams, as well as a training mode where the game teaches the basics of how to play the game.</desc>

In this game you play Joe Yamata (Kujaku) on a quest to rescue Alexandra from the villainous Zao, who is using her soul to resurrect his master Zareth in Azuchi castle. You have four types of magic to attack with and you can charge your blasts as well as change the magic type mid-game.</desc>

		<desc>Warsong is the only title of a series of famous strategy games, known as Langrisser in Japan, to ever see an official release outside of Japan. It is set in a typical medieval fantasy setting and features traditional turn-based combat. The player controls several generals who can command up to eight different units ranging from ordinary soldiers and archers to more exotic creatures like mermen or lizards.The generals fight alongside their units, however they are much more powerful and are able to use more diverse commands than just moving and attacking, like recovering a small amount of HP or casting spells. Each unit has certain strengths and weaknesses; for example soldiers are good against archers but weak against cavalry etc. Combat is also influenced heavily by terrain types. When two units engage in combat a small animation, similar to those seen in Advance Wars or Fire Emblem, is shown.</desc>

		<desc>In Light Crusader, you play the role of Sir David, a knight in the service of King Frederick. You are sent to the town Green Row to help your king's brother, King Weeden, to discover what has caused the mysterious disappearance of his town people. You must enter and explore huge dungeons in order to find out about an ancient story that has happened many years ago, and to face evil forces who threaten the land.

Light Crusader is an isometric action/puzzle adventure with RPG elements, along the lines of Landstalker. You can talk to townspeople, buy weapons and items, etc. You spend most of the game in dungeons, which are populated by enemies (whom you fight in real-time combat), and which are full of various types of traps and puzzles. You'll often have to jump to access higher levels or platforms, push switches and other objects to help you advance, and solve various physical puzzles.</desc>

		<desc>An ancient evil has resurfaced after being sealed underground for thousands of years. The peaceful island, Usonto, has been split into seven pieces, and it's up to our hero, Hat, and his friends to restore the island and defeat the evil king!

Based on the 1989 TV anime Magical Hat, produced by Studio Pierrot and based on the original manga by Yoji Katakura, Magical Hat no Buttobi Turbo! Daiboken (Magical Hat's Flying Turbo! Adventure) is an action platform game not unlike the Master System classic Psycho Fox. You play as the titular Hat, jumping on and punching enemies, grabbing items from statues, and fighting a boss at the end of each world. In each stage, you can find your robot-egg friend Robegg hidden somewhere, who will help you out by acting as a projectile and a shield.

There are a wide range of different power-up items that can be obtained in the game, which will do things like give you temporary invincibility, freeze all the enemies for a short time, give you an extra-high jump, or even call in air support from a helicopter. At the end of each stage, you can play a game of chance to win extra items and lives.

A heavily modified version of the game was released outside of Japan as DEcapAttack. The graphics, sound, story, and many of the stages were changed.</desc>

		<desc>Tsukumo Mutsu, a young student of Karate, has come to the city seeking the Jinmukan dojo, looking for a challenge to prove himself. He's gotten lost, but a young girl helps him out. She happens to be the granddaughter of the head of the dojo, and doesn't want him to get involved with the place, but Tsukumo insists on continuing regardless. He walks right in, and takes on the first guy in a karate gi he comes across...

Shura no Mon is a so-called "command action" game based on the manga by Masatoshi Kawahara. The player controls Tsukumo by selecting commands from a list, using different attacks and defensive maneuvers at the appropriate time, with the results shown via brief animated sequences. Between bouts, lightly-animated visual scenes progress the story. The plot closely follows the first arc from the manga, starting with Tsukumo's arrival at the legendary Jinmukan dojo.</desc>

		<desc>Adol's long time friend, Dogi wishes to return to his home town of Redmont after hearing about strange disturbances that are happening there.  Always looking for an adventure, Adol joins him and soon finds out the cause of this new evil.

Ys III breaks away from the "bumping into enemies" battle system of the first two games and allows Adol to control his sword in a variety of directions.  As well as changing the battle system, the game is now side scrolling instead of the previous games top-down view. Adol also now has the ability to jump.  Not new to the series is the use of magical rings which give Adol different powering up abilities such as healing and shielding.  The game also uses various key items found along the way to solve minor puzzles and progress the story.</desc>

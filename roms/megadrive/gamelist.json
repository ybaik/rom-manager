Travel and exploration occurs in the traditional overhead view of RPGs, while the battles and dungeons are side-scrolling mazes, similar to Wanderers from Ys.

Each unit has certain strengths and weaknesses; for example soldiers are good against archers but weak against cavalry etc. Combat is also influenced heavily by terrain types. When two units engage in combat a small animation, similar to those seen in Advance Wars or Fire Emblem, is shown.",

You, a nameless young man living in Paleo, Mota's capital, are commanded to go to the labs and check the issue. Your friend Nei, a semi-human girl, goes with you, and other brave adventurers join you on what starts with a simple mission but develops into saving the entire world...\n\nThis is the first Phantasy Star game for the Genesis, set in a futuristic world. The turn-based combat allows you to choose between \"fight\", where the characters simply attack physically for one turn, and \"strategy\", where you can choose from several sub-commands, to defend, to use a special technique, or to run from the battle. Instead of magic there are \"techniques\", that require the usage of TP (technique points).",

        "desc": "The Immortal is an isometric action-adventure game.\n\nYour old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably kidnapped. You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of \nisometric death await.\n\nThe Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards. In short: You want to see what challenge lies in the next room.\n\nThe puzzles range from simple avoidance of traps to the correct use of items; you collect objects in an inventory. Every now and then, The Immortal surprises with a special challenge. For example, you've got to ride a magic carpet through a hallway full of fire traps, or ride a barrel on an underground river. The dungeon isn't empty: some friedlies may have valuable information or trade items, the nasty sort of guys will attack. Combat is fought man-to-man on a special screen. Your adversary indicates his next attack a few seconds before he executes it, so you've got time to react appropriately. You can dodge to the left or the right, as well as attack from these two directions. There is no save option in the game, of course, but you may restart each level as often as you like. Levels can be skipped by entering passwords.",
